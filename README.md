my programming language

yes, i'm working on it again, now with ANOTHER rewrite

purpose:
    being very lightweight to compile / assemble
    being easy to port (the assembler syntax leans well into being ported, stripped down, etc)

    being close to the c programming language for easy ports

features:

mimicks the B language and C89

assembly syntax is somewhere between intel and at&t, less implicit than intel but more readable than at&t

concisety
    

less ambiguous than c
    avoiding reused symbols (* for pointer and for multiply, and dereference)
    more strict, no synonyms


examples:
test.pom
test.psm
