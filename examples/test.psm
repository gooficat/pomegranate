; this is an assembly syntax by gooficat
; it is derived from at & t assembly
; a label is an alphanumerical followed by a colon
; if there is no colon, it is an instruction if it comes on its own without anything before it
; an alphanumerical can also be referencing a label if its name is not that of an instruction
; a percent sign indicates a register
; a number defaults to an immediate value, and if there is a dollar sign before it, it is a memory address.
;this is the opposite of gnu assembly
; a square left bracket means indirection begins
; a square right bracket ends the indirection
; for supporting 6502 style syntaxes, we allow indirection to be like this:
; "lda [%x, $6741]"
; hexadecimal and binary are supported too, without
; 0x and 0b prefixes

; it's worth noting, although it is implied above, that an address shall be used (for jumps and calls) by using the memory prefix
